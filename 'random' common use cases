# The ‘random’ module is used in various fields and applications where randomness 
#Here are some common use cases:

# in cryptography (Although the random module itself is not suitable for cryptographic purposes, randomness is essential in cryptography for generating secure keys, initialization vectors, and nonces)

import secrets

#generate a secure random token
secure_token = secrets.token_hex(16)
print(secure_token)


# in machine learing (Random numbers are used in machine learning for initializing weights, splitting data into training and testing sets, and performing random sampling)

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Creating a sample dataset
data = np.array([i for i in range(100)])
labels = np.array([0 if i < 50 else 1 for i in range(100)])

# Splitting the dataset
train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
print(train_data, test_data)

# in Random sampling

population = list(range(1, 101))
sample = random.sample(population, 10)
print(sample)

# in Art and Music

# Generating random colors for a painting
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'black', 'white']
painting = [random.choice(colors) for _ in range(100)]
print(painting)

# in Games

# Shuffling a deck of cards
deck = list(range(1, 53))
random.shuffle(deck)
print(deck)
